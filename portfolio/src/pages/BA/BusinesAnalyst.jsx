          <h1>üß© Project Overview</h1>
          <p>
            As part of my Level 6 Business Analysis internship with Mission
            Ready HQ, I joined Lean Canvas, a Christchurch-based coworking and
            event space, as a Business Analyst Intern. My goal was to move the
            organization from fragmented, manual processes into streamlined,
            scalable digital systems using Agile and design thinking principles.
            The focus was on replacing the "scrappy" Google Sheets-based
            operations with a centralized ERP system (Odoo), while improving
            room bookings, onboarding, visitor management, marketing, and
            volunteer coordination.

        <div className={styles.statement}>
          <h1>‚ùì The Challenge</h1>
          <p>
            Lean Canvas operated using disconnected tools: spreadsheets for
            bookings, pen-and-paper visitor logs, interpersonal onboarding, and
            ad hoc messaging in Discord. This led to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Frequent double bookings and poor visibility over space usage
            </li>
            <li>Security and data privacy concerns</li>
            <li>Limited marketing capabilities</li>
            <li>Difficulty onboarding new clients and volunteers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The overarching goal was to digitally transform core operational
            processes using tools already available in the business (Odoo ERP),
            while following the Lean philosophy of "Scrappy ‚Üí Better ‚Üí Best."
